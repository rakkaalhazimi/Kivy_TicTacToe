# Authors
Rakka Alhazimi, May 2020

Requirements
* Python 3
* Kivy

# Usage
To start the application, run:: python3 main.py

# General Notes
The application may be slow at the first turn because I didn't implement Alpha-Beta Pruning yet.

# Author Notes
Developing GUI with Kivy is not quite simple. The simple part is when I need to style my widgets using kivy language. 
The hardest part is when you need a reference about your root widget. It force to assign an instance from app subclass,
and access my root widget throught.
